# GCN Circulars

GCN Circulars are rapid astronomical bulletins submitted by and distributed to community members worldwide.

- Circulars are **brief**, **citeable**, and **human-readable**.
- Circulars can announce observations, quantitative near-term predictions, requests for follow-up observations, or future observing plans.

Circulars allow the GRB community to **email** messages to a central queue where they are automatically vetted and distributed to the entire GRB community. These prose-style messages allow the community to coordinate and make optimum use of its limited resources.

The GCN Circulars list is independent from the machine-readable [GCN Notices (TODO:link)](notices) system.

<SummaryBox heading="Summary">

1. Email your submission to gcncirc@capella2.gsfc.nasa.gov.

2. The email subject line must contain at least one of the strings in the [list of
   instruments and source types](#subject-word-list).

</SummaryBox>

We will verify that you are a valid submitter. Make sure you are submitting your email from the address you used to [sign up](#subscribing).

You will receive either a _success_ or a _problem_ report:

- If you are valid submitter, within 2 to 3 minutes you will receive three emails as notification of success:
  - An immediate email that your submission was a success
  - A generic email message that your submission was successful and was distributed
  - An email giving the number of recipients your Circular was distributed to and the time difference from first to last.
    In addition, you will receive a copy of the outgoing Circular if you have elected to receive them.
- If your submission was rejected, within a minute you will be notified via email along with an explanation of the possible reasons
  for this and what remedies you can employ to allow a successful resubmission.

## Archive

GCN Circulars are atuomatically archived. There are various ways to access past Circulars:

- The list of all Circulars [in serial number order](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3_archive.html).
- A human-curated list of Circulars [grouped by object](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/selected.html).
- The [GCN Viewer](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/tachgcn), which aumatically ingests and parses GCN Circulars, and fills out a searchable relational database.

## Style Guide

Every Circular begins with the header information described above, determined by the GCN system, the email subject line, and the approved submitted. The content within the circular should always begin with the ordered author list with affiliations. This is then followed by the scientific content.

- **One Event per Circular:** Each message should be limited to discussion of a single event, i.e. a GRB or a GW. Reporting multiple candidate counterparts is acceptable as this is observations specific to a single event. If you have observations on more than one event then you must divide them into multiple submissions. This allows for automated grouping of circulars by individual event.
- **Near-Term**: Circulars must be timely. Their content must be relevant to inform potential additional observations for that specific event. A nominal working definition is a few weeks which is generally sufficient for GRBs and kilonovae; however, long-evolving transients allow for longer term consideration (e.g. the afterglow of GRB 170817A).
- **Just the Facts:** Submitters are discouraged from editorializing, debating, critiquing, etc other people's work and reports. This is not a "discussion group" nor a "chat room". Limit your submissions to just the facts of your observations, the conclusions to be drawn from your observations, plans for future observations, & requests for correlated efforts with the rest of the community. However, if your observations are in disagreement with another observation, you can of course discuss these differences in your Circular.
- **Writing Style:** Please remember that this media (e-mail) does not lend itself to a wide latitude of inter-personal communications. That is to say, the reader does not have access to the writer's "tone of voice", facial expressions, nor (in some cases) knowledge of the writer's personality. So a casually used phrase might be taken the wrong way by the reader. Please keep your writing style to that used in scientific journals.
- **Quality of Content:** It is understood by everyone in the GCN/GRB/transient community that these reports are preliminary. While everyone makes their best attempt to submit accurate reports, these reports are also timely, based on preliminary analysis, and may be subject to change when the full analysis is done months later. See the "Corrections" section below.

### Scope

Acceptable content for the GCN Circulars falls within only four areas:

- **Observations:** A brief report on new observations, including observing conditions, analysis methods, and conclusions. Comparison with previously reported results is acceptable, simply critique or editorialize another's report. Significant hanges in analysis, interpretation, or results of previous data can be reported in an additional Circular.
- **Quantitative Near-Term Predictions:** Circulars which contain theory or model-based predictions on future expectations are acceptable only when they contain quantitiave predictions with a confidence level and are relevant in the near-term (defined below). This is necessary both to guide the submitter to consider their certitude and to inform observers who may use this information. Specific good examples:
  - "the OT will brighten in the I-band by 0.5-2 mags in the next 3-5 days"
  - "the probability of a repeated lensed event is less than 10% in the next 2 weeks, but if it happens it will be about 3 arcsec to the north of the current OT position"
  - "to separate the X & Y models, the observations must be made in the I & R bands and should be taken hourly".
- **Requests for Correlated or Cooperative Observations:** Requests for observations to be made by others for coordinated follow-up across wavelengths, in response to local bad weather, the need for longer-term monitoring, etc.
- **Future Plans:** Sites can make statements about future plans for observations. An example would be "HST will image the OT plus host galaxy to X-th mag Y days from now (and the data will be made available to the public within Z hours)".

### Message Content

- **Subject-line Format:** The subject line in your submission should describe the event being discussed (e.g. GRB YYMMDDa, SYYMMDDa, ATYYYYxyz), the observation (e.g. Fermi-GBM, LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA, VLA, etc), and a description of the results (e.g. discovery, detection, upper limits, etc). The Circular subject line is "SUBJECT:" prepended to your email subject. Automatic subject-line filters are in place to prevent spam Circulars (e.g. rejecting all subject lines with "RE:", "vacation", "?", etc).
- **Contact Information:** You can list "contact" information (e.g. phone number(s) & e-mail address(s), especially if different than the address that appears in the by-line) to allow the reader to contact you for further communications. However, ensure email signatures are not sent in the email content for your circular.
- **Total Length:** Circular submissions should be brief, generally less than 60 lines, as they must be easily digestable by observers for prompt follow-up. The text must contain the salient information for follow-up.
- **URLs & Tables:** It is acceptable to provide a URL in cases where content does not fit within the Style Guide. The URL must be active at the time of Circular submission. Examples include reports of many observations, images or spctra, or detailed descriptions of model assumptions for predictive circulars. However, see "Dont's" below.
- **Tabs and Special Characters:** The use of tabs in producing tables is cautioned, because the recipient may have a different tab-stop setting than the one you used (tabstops of 4 and 8 spaces are common). The use of special characters (e.g. control characters) is strongly discouraged, as well are any formatting type directives (e.g. LaTeX, \*roff, MSWord, etc), since it is extremely unlikely that the reader will have access to these formatting packages, especially at remote locations like telescope domes, etc. And do not include question marks ("?") in the Subject line. And for things like exponentiation, please use techniques like: 1.2x10^-11 erg/cm2-s or 1.2x10E-11 erg/cm^2-s, etc.
- **Line Length:** People are encouraged to keep the line length to about 70-75 characters. The use of proportional fonts when composing a circular is discouraged. The reason being that when read by people using fixed-width fonts (a common choice) the line lengths come out a little longer, and as a result strange 1 or 2-word orphaned lines come out.
- **Line Breaks:** It is now getting common that people use mailers with an editor window that automatically inserts line breaks on the screen. However, these line breaks are not actually in the message. As such, when they are received/read by people using simple-text displays, they appear as one long giant line that wraps on their screens at strange places. Please insert explicit line-breaks into your text when composing the circular.
- **MIME/Mailer Stuff:** The processing of the incoming circular submissions is now MIME-compliant. That means any HTML-ized duplicates attached will be ignored -- only the plain_text version will be distributed. Attachments will also be deleted from the outgoing distribution.

### Referencing, Citations, and Acknowledgements

- **References:** References to previous GCN Circulars on an event are required; references to external articles are acceptable. References to previous GCN Circulars should be of the form "J. Doe, et al., GCN Circ. 270" or "J. Doe, et al., GCN Circ. 270, 1998". Note "J. Doe" should be the first author of the Circular, which sometimes differs from the submitter (the FROM-line entry). References to journal articles, books, etc, follow the standard conventions and formats.
- **Support Acknowledgements:** It is quite acceptable to included statements acknowledging support (eg "This work was supported by XYZ Grant #1234." or "This work was conducted using the National Hoosits Facility.", etc).
- **Citability (all are citable by default):** All Circulars are citable and indexed as such. Journal articles, books, etc that make use of content in Circulars should cite them the same as journal articles.
- **Citations:** Since these GRB follow-up efforts are fast-paced, it is possible that not everyone will be aware of all previous work. The reasons are numerous: people may not have access to their normal or full e-mail accounts, they have just spent the last two hours furiously analyzing their own data, it's 5 o'clock in the morning and the mind is somewhat frazzled by lack of sleep, etc. As such, a reference to prior work may be innocently left out of the current Circular. While everyone will make an honest effort to be current and to cite prior work, it is understood that some omissions will inevitably happen.

### Dont's

- Do not submit a Circular without a specified event in the title
- Do not submit instrument specific information. Submit physical units (with specified energy range). E.g. do not quote "we detect Event X at 10 cts", report "we detect Event X at 1.0E-12 erg/s/cm^2 in the 0.2-10 keV energy range"
- Do not use the Circulars as an advertisement to some paper or web page.
- Do not include your email signature in the submitted Circular content.
- Do not use special characters or LaTeX formatting
- Do not produce excessively long or unfocused Circulars
- Do not submit automated circulars from templates without clear language and grammar
- Do not imply you alone discover a transient that has already been reported
- Do not neglect to mention potential systematic errors if they are expeced
- Do not declare an event start time if you likely missed the beginning

### Do's

- Work together to discover secrets of the Universe
